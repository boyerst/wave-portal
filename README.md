# WavePortal 

This is my project built for the course [Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts](https://buildspace.so/solidity) at [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/).

The course demonstrates how to build, deploy and test a smart contract on the Rinkeby testnet.


The end product is a social-mediaesque portal on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to interact via Waves and messages. Every interaction includes a chance to win a prize - a small, super valuable amount of Rinkeby testnet ETH!
